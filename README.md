# Capstone-Project-Modul-2
A supermarket is a large retail store that offers a wide range of daily necessities and consumer products under one roof, 
designed for convenient shopping with competitive pricing and various additional services.

By acquiring customer data, supermarkets can conduct customer analysis. 
The purpose of this analysis is to gain a deep understanding of consumer purchasing behaviors. 
By examining customer data including demographics, product preferences, purchasing patterns, 
responses to promotions, and purchase locations, supermarkets can identify consumer trends, 
improve targeted marketing strategies, and develop tactics to maximize supermarket profits.

**Analysis Result:**
_How is expenditure by product categories and the association between product categories?_
The highest expenditure is on the wine product category, followed by meat. 
Additionally, there are positive correlations among all product categories, with some showing fairly strong associations which suggests that customers who spend more on one category are likely to spend more on other categories as well.

_What is the relationship between the distribution of supermarket customer demographics and their spending across different product categories?_
The supermarket customer demographics correlate with spending across various product categories. 
Notably, customers with a PhD demonstrate the highest overall spending, particularly on wine products. 
Additionally, customers categorized as "absurd" in marital status exhibit the highest supermarket expenditure. 


_How are the results of the promotional campaign conducted by the supermarket?_
Most campaigns were successful, achieving response rates above 5%, with the exception of the second campaign, which yielded a lower response rate. This highlights the effectiveness of targeted promotional strategies in driving customer engagement and underscores the need for further analysis to optimize future campaign performance.


_How is the distribution of purchasing channel usage by supermarket customers?_
Most supermarket customers prefer buying in-store, with web purchases slightly behind. 
There's a trend showing fewer customers using the web over time. 
It's crucial to focus on both in-store experiences and improving online shopping options to match customer needs.
